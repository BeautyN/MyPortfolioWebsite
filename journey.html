                    <h3> What is ADA :</h3>
                    <p class="journeyText"> ADA, named after Ada Lovelace (the first female coder), is a non-profit programme which aims to educate young women of colour to become Front-End Developers and join the tech industry. ADA provides an immersive, mentored, fully-funded
                        web development education to young, African, women. ADA's mission is to empower. They give young, African women the tools and confidence to become successful game-changers in the field of technology by providing them with immersive,
                        mentored, fully-funded Front-End Development education.

                    <h3> How was I selected :</h3>
                    <p>The African Developers Academy had limited capacity in its first ever year, and so had to be rigorous in their testing and eventual selection of the student body of 2019/2020. This meant that students had to apply first through Harambe,
                        where they completed a series of aptitude tests to make sure that they had what it takes to be a web developer. There were 500 applications, 100 selected candidates through Harambe and only 12 spots. This means that only 2% of
                        applicants would make it through. All of the 100 selected candidates were invited to take part in challenges hosted by ADA which put them to the test - checking for resilience, strength of character, attitude and of course ability.
                        The women who made it through proved themselves in many ways, and continued to do so throughout their studies.

                <h3> My coding journey:</h3>
                <p class="journeyText">My coding journey began when I was selected to be one of 12 students in the African Developers Academy. It all started when I joined Harambee. My main reason for applying was that I needed a job and I saw an opportunity I could not afford
                    to lose.At first it was about getting an income to sustain myself , provide for my son and family.</p>

                <P>I had to begin a grueling testing process, first with Harambe and then with ADA; coming in on two weekends to participate in the bootcamps that ADA provided, I didnâ€™t know what was going to happen but soon afterwards I received an email
                    from them saying that I had been accepted. Getting the offer to be part of ADA was the greatest thing that has happened to me in a while, it was an achievement for me because it was not an easy process. I was really happy and honored
                    .
                </p>

                <p>Most importantly I discovered that I have an aptitude for coding and am really passionate about the impact technology has on our lives . When I came to ADA I did not know anything about coding.I only had basic computer literacy. Learning
                    to code is not simple, there were just as many difficult struggles as there were successes.I have learned so many things through perseverance, interacting with distinct individuals, journaling, working under pressure, presenting my
                    work to lecturers and my peers, conducting research and coding.</p>

                <p>Not only did I learn,but I also found myself a second home, a bunch of sisters that are so caring and supportive - at ADA you never struggle alone. Everyone is there, willing to help where they can. I can confidently say that I am a better
                    person because of the program and the challenges that I have overcome.</p>
